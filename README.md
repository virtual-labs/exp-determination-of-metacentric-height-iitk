### About the Experiment 

Buoyancy: 
When a body is immersed in a fluid either wholly of partially, it is buoyed or lifted up by a force, which is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the body.

Centre of Buoyancy: The point of application of the force of buoyancy on the body is known as the centre of buoyancy. It is always the centre of gravity of the volume of fluid displaced.

Metacentre: Figure shows a body floating in a liquid in a state of equilibrium. When it is given a small angular displacement, it starts oscillating about some point M. This point, about which the body oscillating, it is called metacentre. 

The metacentre may also be defined as a point of intersection of the axis of body passing through centre of gravity G and original centre of buoyancy B and a vertical line passing through the centre of buoyancy B1 of the tilled position of the body.
