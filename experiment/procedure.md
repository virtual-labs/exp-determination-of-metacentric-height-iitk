### Procedure
1.	Note down the relevant dimensions as area of collecting tank, mass density of water etc.
2.	Note down the water level in the tank when pontoon is not in the tank.
3.	Pontoon is allowed to float in the tank. Note down the reading of water level in the tank. Mass of pontoon can be obtained by the help of Archimedesâ€™s principle.
4.	Position of unbalanced mass, weight of unbalanced mass and the angle of heel can be noted down. Calculated the metacentric height of the pontoon.
5.	The procedure is repeated for other positions and value of unbalanced mass.
6.	Also the above procedure is repeated while changing the weight of the pontoon by changing the number of strips in the pontoon.
