Metacentric height: The distance between the centre of gravity of a floating body and the metacentre is called metacentric height. 
For stable equilibrium, the position of metacentre M remains higher than centre of gravity of the body G.
For unstable equilibrium, the position of metacentre M remains lower than G.
For neutral equilibrium, the position of metacentre M coincides with G.
